# üöÄ GitHub Setup Instructions for Seren Capture

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repositories

Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and create two new repositories:

### Backend Repository
- **Name**: `seren-capture`
- **Description**: `üè† Residential Access Control Image Capture System - Backend API with EstateMate integration, secure image storage, and demo mode`
- **Visibility**: Public
- **Initialize**: Don't add README, .gitignore, or license (we already have them)

### Mobile App Repository
- **Name**: `seren-capture-mobile`
- **Description**: `üì± React Native/Expo Mobile App for Seren Capture System - Camera integration, offline demo mode, modern UI`
- **Visibility**: Public
- **Initialize**: Don't add README, .gitignore, or license (we already have them)

## Step 2: Push Backend Repository

```bash
# You're currently in: /Users/lwando/Projects/seren-capture
# Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your actual GitHub username

git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/seren-capture.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 3: Push Mobile App Repository

```bash
# Switch to mobile app directory
cd ../seren-capture-mobile

# Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your actual GitHub username
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/seren-capture-mobile.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 4: Verify Repositories

After pushing, your repositories should contain:

### seren-capture (Backend)
- ‚úÖ Complete Node.js/Express backend
- ‚úÖ API routes and services
- ‚úÖ Demo mode with sample data
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive README
- ‚úÖ Environment configuration

### seren-capture-mobile (Mobile App)
- ‚úÖ Complete React Native/Expo app
- ‚úÖ 4 main screens with navigation
- ‚úÖ Camera integration
- ‚úÖ Backend API integration
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive README

## Quick Commands (Copy & Paste)

**For Backend (run from /seren-capture):**
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/seren-capture.git
git push -u origin main
```

**For Mobile App (run from /seren-capture-mobile):**
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/seren-capture-mobile.git
git push -u origin main
```

## What You'll Have on GitHub

After completing these steps, you'll have two public repositories showcasing:

1. **Professional Backend System** - Complete residential access control API
2. **Modern Mobile App** - React Native app with camera integration
3. **Demo Mode** - Working system that can be tested immediately
4. **Comprehensive Documentation** - Detailed READMEs for both projects
5. **Production Ready** - Both projects ready for deployment

## Repository URLs (after creation)

- Backend: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/seren-capture`
- Mobile: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/seren-capture-mobile`

## Next Steps After GitHub Push

1. **Add Repository Links** to your portfolio/resume
2. **Deploy Backend** to cloud service (Heroku, Railway, etc.)
3. **Build Mobile App** for App Store/Play Store
4. **Set up CI/CD** for automatic deployments
5. **Add Contributors** if working with a team
